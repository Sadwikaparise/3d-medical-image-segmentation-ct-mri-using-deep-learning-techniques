# **3D MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION (CT/MRI) USING DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES**
# **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
#This project introduces an innovative approach to automating tooth segmentation in volumetric dental images using advanced deep learning techniques, particularly
leveraging the U-Net architecture. Dental image analysis plays a crucial role in modern dentistry, aiding in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and research endeavors. Manual segmentation of teeth from volumetric scans is not only laborious but also prone to inconsistencies, highlighting the necessity for automated solutions.The project unfolds in three primary phases: data preprocessing, model training,and segmentation. During data preprocessing, volumetric dental images undergo
normalization of intensity ranges and standardization of resolutions to ensure consistency across datasets. The model training phase involves the implementation and
fine-tuning of the U-Net architecture using annotated dental image datasets, with optimization techniques including data augmentation and transfer learning to enhance
model performance. Subsequently, in the segmentation phase, the trained model is deployed to predict tooth masks from previously unseen dental images. Evaluation
metrics such as the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) are employed for quantitative assessment, complemented by qualitative inspection of segmented tooth masks. This
project aims to deliver an accurate, efficient, and reliable method for tooth segmentation, contributing to streamlined dental image analysis processes and ultimately
facilitating improved clinical decision-making and patient care in the field of dentistry. With an efficiency rate of 81.6542%, the proposed system offers a significant advancement in automating tooth segmentation, promising to reduce manual effort and enhance accuracy in dental image analysis.
